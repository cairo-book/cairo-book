"Cairo is a programming language designed for a virtual CPU of the same name. "
"The unique aspect of this processor is that it was not created for the "
"physical constraints of our world but for cryptographic ones, making it "
"capable of efficiently proving the execution of any program running on it. "
"This means that you can perform time consuming operations on a machine you "
"don't trust, and check the result very quickly on a cheaper machine.\n"
"While Cairo 0 used to be directly compiled to CASM, the Cairo CPU assembly, "
"Cairo 1 is a more high level language. It first compiles to Sierra, an "
"intermediate representation of Cairo which will compile later down to a safe "
"subset of CASM. The point of Sierra is to ensure your CASM will always be "
"provable, even when the computation fails."

"Cairo est un langage de programmation conçu pour un processeur virtuel du même nom. "

"Cela signifie que vous pouvez effectuer des opérations complexes sur une machine "

"Cairo allows you to compute trustworthy values on untrusted machines. One "
"major usecase is Starknet, a solution to Ethereum scaling. Ethereum is a "
"decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of decentralized "
"applications where every single interaction between a user and a d-app is "
"verified by all the participants. Starknet is a Layer 2 built on top of "
"Ethereum. Instead of having all the participants of the network to verify "
"all user interactions, only one node, called the prover, execute the "
"programs and generate proofs that the computations were done correctly.These "
"proofs are then verified by an Ethereum smart contract, requiring "
"significantly less computational power compared to executing the "
"interactions themselves. This approach allows for increased throughput and "
"reduced transaction costs but preserving Ethereum security."

"Starknet est une seconde couche construite au-dessus d'Ethereum. "
"Au lieu de demander à tous les participants du réseau de vérifier toutes les interactions des utilisateurs, "
"seul un nœud, appelé le "prover", exécute les programmes et génère des preuves que les calculs ont été effectués correctement. "
"Ces preuves sont ensuite vérifiées par un smart contract déployé sur Ethereum, "
"ce qui nécessite une puissance de calcul considérablement inférieure par rapport à l'exécution des transactions elles-mêmes. "
"Cette approche permet d'augmenter le débit et de réduire les coûts des transactions tout en préservant la sécurité d'Ethereum."

"Cairo is quite different from traditional programming languages, especially "
"when it comes to overhead costs and its primary advantages. Your program can "
"be executed in two different ways:"
msgstr ""
"Cairo est assez différent des langages de programmation traditionnels, notamment "

"- When executed by the prover, it is similar to any other language. Because "
"Cairo is virtualized, and because the operations were not specifically "
"designed for maximum efficiency, this can lead to some performance overhead "
"but it is not the most relevant part to optimize.\n"
"\n"
"- When the generated proof is verified by a verifier, it is a bit different. "
"This has to be as cheap as possible since it could potentially be verified "
"on many very small machines. Fortunately verifying is faster than computing "
"and Cairo has some unique advantages to improve it even more. A notable one "
"is non-determinism. This is a topic you will cover in more detail later in "
"this book, but the idea is that you can theoretically use a different "
"algorithm for verifying than for computing. Currently, writing custom non-"
"deterministic code is not supported for the developers, but the standard "
"library leverages non-determinism for improved performance. For example "
"sorting an array in Cairo costs the same price than copying it. Because the "
"verifier doesn't sort the array, it just checks that it is sorted, which is "
"cheaper."
msgstr ""
"- Lorsqu'il est exécuté par le "prover", le langage Cairo est similaire à n'importe quel autre langage. En raison "
"de sa virtualisation et du fait que les opérations n'ont pas été spécifiquement "
"conçues pour une efficacité maximale, cela peut entraîner une surcharge de performance, "
"mais ce n'est pas la partie la plus pertinente à optimiser.\n"
"\n"
"- Lorsque la preuve générée est vérifiée par un vérificateur, le processus est un peu différent. "
"Cette vérification doit être aussi peu coûteuse que possible, car elle peut éventuellement être effectuée "
"sur de nombreuses machines très petites. Heureusement, la vérification est plus rapide que le calcul, "
"et Cairo présente quelques avantages uniques pour l'améliorer encore davantage. L'un de ces avantages notables "
"est le non-déterminisme. Ce sujet sera abordé en détail ultérieurement "
"dans ce livre, mais l'idée est que vous pouvez théoriquement utiliser un algorithme différent "
"pour la vérification que pour le calcul. Actuellement, l'écriture de code non "
"déterministe personnalisé n'est pas prise en charge pour les développeurs, mais la bibliothèque standard "
"tire parti du non-déterminisme pour améliorer les performances. Par exemple, "
"trier un tableau dans Cairo coûte le même prix que le copier. En effet, "
"le vérificateur ne trie pas le tableau, il vérifie simplement s'il est trié, ce qui est "
"moins coûteux en termes de calcul."

"Another aspect that sets the language apart is its memory model. In Cairo, "
"memory access is immutable, meaning that once a value is written to memory, "
"it cannot be changed. Cairo 1 provides abstractions that help developers "
"work with these constraints, but it does not fully simulate mutability. "
"Therefore, developers must think carefully about how they manage memory and "
"data structures in their programs to optimize performance."
msgstr ""
"Un autre aspect qui distingue le langage est son modèle de mémoire. Dans Cairo, "
"l'accès à la mémoire est immuable, ce qui signifie qu'une fois qu'une valeur est écrite en mémoire, "
"elle ne peut pas être modifiée. Cairo 1 propose des abstractions qui aident les développeurs "
"à travailler avec ces contraintes, mais il ne simule pas entièrement la mutabilité. "
"Par conséquent, les développeurs doivent réfléchir attentivement à la gestion de la mémoire et "
"des structures de données dans leurs programmes pour optimiser les performances."

"- **Start from the crate root**: When compiling a crate, the compiler first\n"
"  looks in the crate root file (_src/lib.cairo_) for code to compile.\n"
"- **Declaring modules**: In the crate root file, you can declare new "
"modules;\n"
"  say, you declare a “garden” module with `mod garden;`. The compiler will "
"look\n"
"  for the module’s code in these places:\n"
"\n"
"  - Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following `mod "
"garden;`.\n"
"\n"
"    ```rust\n"
"      // crate root file (lib.cairo)\n"
"        mod garden {\n"
"        // code defining the garden module goes here\n"
"        }\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"- In the file _src/garden.cairo_\n"
"- **Declaring submodules**: In any file other than the crate root, you can\n"
"  declare submodules. For example, you might declare `mod vegetables;` in\n"
"  _src/garden.cairo_. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within "
"the\n"
"  directory named for the parent module in these places:\n"
"\n"
"  - Inline, directly following `mod vegetables`, within curly brackets "
"instead\n"
"    of the semicolon.\n"
"\n"
"    ```rust\n"
"    // src/garden.cairo file\n"

"  `backyard::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`, you can create a shortcut with\n"

"At its simplest, a test in Cairo is a function that’s annotated with the "
"`test` attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Cairo code; one "
"example is the derive attribute we used with structs in Chapter 4. To change "
"a function into a test function, add `#[test]` on the line before `fn`. When "
"you run your tests with the `cairo-test` command, Cairo builds a test runner "
"binary that runs the annotated functions and reports on whether each test "
"function passes or fails."

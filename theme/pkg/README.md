## üö¥ Usage


### üõ†Ô∏è Build WASM-bindgen's WASM-Cairo Toolkit 
With Modules

```
wasm-pack build --release --target web --out-dir ./pkg/module --out-name wasm-cairo
```

No Modules

```
wasm-pack build --release --target no-modules --out-dir ./pkg/no_module --out-name wasm-cairo
```

You will find `wasm-cairo_bg.wasm` and `wasm-cairo.js` in `pkg` folder.

### üõ†Ô∏è Build WASMTIME's WASM-Cairo Toolkit

```
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

You can test it by using: 

Compile Cairo

```
./wasmtime_test.sh compileCairoProgram ./cairo_files/HelloStarknetAstro.cairo ./cairo_files/HelloStarknetAstro.sierra
```

Run
```
./wasmtime_test.sh runCairoProgram ./cairo_files/HelloStarknetAstro.cairo
```

Compile Contract

```
./wasmtime_test.sh compileStarknetContract ./cairo_files/erc20.cairo ./cairo_files/erc20.json
```

## üîã Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.
* [`Cairo`](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) for Cairo-lang support.
* `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`: most Rust projects are licensed this way, so these are included for you

### Setup

1. Rust related packages:
   - Install toolchain providing `cargo` using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
   - Install [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) and the translation extension:
   ```
   cargo install mdbook mdbook-i18n-helpers
   ```
2. Host machine packages:
   - Install [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) for translations, usually available with regular package manager:
   `sudo apt install gettext`.

3. Clone this repository.

### Work locally (english, main language)

All the Markdown files **MUST** be edited in english. To work locally in english:

   - Start a local server with `mdbook server` and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the book.
   You can use the `--open` flag to open the browser automatically: `mdbook serve --open`.

   - Make changes to the book and refresh the browser to see the changes.

   - Open a PR with your changes.

### Work locally (translations)

This book is targetting international audience, and aims at being gradually translated in several languages.

**All files in the `src` directory MUST be written in english**. This ensures that all the translation files can be
auto-generated and updated by translators.

To work with translations, those are the steps to update the translated content:

   - Run a local server for the language you want to edit: `./translations.sh es` for instance. If no language is provided, the script will only extract translations from english.

   - Open the translation file you are interested in `po/es.po` for instance. You can also use editors like [poedit](https://poedit.net/) to help you on this task.

   - When you are done, you should only have changes into the `po/xx.po` file. Commit them and open a PR.
   The PR must stars with `i18n` to let the maintainers know that the PR is only changing translation.

The translation work is inspired from [Comprehensive Rust repository](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/blob/main/TRANSLATIONS.md).

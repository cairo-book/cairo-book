prompt.prompt = """
In Cairo, the `panic` function can be triggered in two ways:
1. Inadvertently, through actions causing the code to panic.
2. Executing a valid Cairo program.
3. Using the `nopanic` notation.
4. Deliberately, by invoking the `panic` function.

There are two primary ways that a panic can be triggered in Cairo: inadvertently, through actions causing the code to panic (e.g., accessing an array beyond its bounds),

Code Block 3 accesses an array out of bounds, leading to an inadvertent panic as the program attempts to access an invalid memory location. Code Block 1 and Code Block 2 are intentionally causing panics using panic! and panic_with_felt252, respectively, making them deliberate panics.

What is the purpose of the `panic_with` attribute in Cairo?

The panic_with attribute in Cairo is used to mark a function that returns an `Option or `Result`. It
creates a wrapper function for the annotated function that panics if the function returns `None` or
`Err`, using the specified data as the panic error.

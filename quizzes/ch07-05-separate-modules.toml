Consider this module and `use` statement:
```markdown
foobar
├── Scarb.toml
└── src/
    ├── lib.cairo
    ├── engine.cairo
    └── engine/
        └── analysis.cairo
```
The contents of each file are:
```
// engine/analysis.cairo
pub fn run() {}

// engine.cairo
mod analysis;
pub use analysis::run;

// lib.cairo
pub mod engine;
```
Say that another Cairo developer is using the `foobar` crate in a separate package, and they want to call the `run` function. 
What is the path they would write?
"""
answer.answer = "foobar::engine::run"
context = """
The module tree generated by this directory structure is as follows:
```
foobar
└── engine
    └── run
```
Therefore the path to run is `foobar::engine::run`.

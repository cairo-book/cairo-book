# Starknet contracts: ABIs and cross-contract interactions

Interactions between smart contracts are an important feature when creating complex decentralized applications, as it allows for composability and separation of concerns. This chapter sheds light on how to make contracts interact with each other.

Specifically, you'll learn about ABIs, contract interfaces, the contract and library dispatchers and their low-level system call equivalents!

# EC OP Builtin

The _EC OP_ builtin is dedicated to compute the point R = P + mQ where P and Q are points on the STARK curve and m is a scalar. Each point (P, Q and R) is represented by two field elements, x and y.

## Cells organization

The EC OP builtin has its own segment during a Cairo VM run.
It works with blocks of 7 cells (5 inputs and 2 outputs):

- The first two cells are inputs storing the x and y coordinates of the point P. _(Offset 0 and 1)_
- The next two cells are inputs storing the x and y coordinates of the point Q. _(Offset 2 and 3)_
- The next cell is an input storing the scalar m. _(Offset 4)_
- The next two cells are outputs storing the x and y coordinates of the point R. _(Offset 5 and 6)_

In this snapshot, we wrote the coordinates of the points P and Q and the scalar m (inputs). The runner computes the point R = P + mQ and writes the result in the last two cells (outputs).

On the second snapshot, we try read the coordinates of the point R but some input values are missing. This will throw an error.

Why is there an error? We want the runner to compute the point R = P + mQ. To do so, we need to provide the coordinates of the points P and Q and the scalar m. If one or more of these values is missing or invalid (not a Felt for example), the runner will throw an error. Here, we didn't provide the coordinates of the point Q.

## Hello, World

Now that you’ve installed Cairo through Scarb, it’s time to write your first Cairo program.
It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that
prints the text `Hello, world!` to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!

> Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Cairo makes
> no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so
> if you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) instead of
> the command line, feel free to use your favorite IDE. The Cairo team has developed
> a VSCode extension for the Cairo language that you can use to get the features from
> the language server and code highlighting. See [Appendix D][devtools]
> for more details.

### Creating a Project Directory

You’ll start by making a directory to store your Cairo code. It doesn’t matter
to Cairo where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this book,
we suggest making a _cairo_projects_ directory in your home directory and keeping all
your projects there.

Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a _cairo_projects_ directory
and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the _cairo_projects_ directory.

> Note: From now on, for each example shown in the book, we assume that
> you will be working from a Scarb project directory. If you are not using Scarb, and try to run the examples from a different directory, you might need to adjust the commands accordingly or create a Scarb project.

For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:

```shell
mkdir ~/cairo_projects
cd ~/cairo_projects
```

For Windows CMD, enter this:

```cmd
> mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\cairo_projects"
> cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\cairo_projects"
```

### Creating a Project with Scarb

Let’s create a new project using Scarb.

Navigate to your projects directory (or wherever you decided to store your code). Then run the following:

```bash
scarb new hello_world
```

It creates a new directory and project called `hello_world`. We’ve named our project `hello_world`, and Scarb creates its files in a directory of the same name.

Go into the `hello_world` directory with the command `cd hello_world`. You’ll see that Scarb has generated two files and one directory for us: a `Scarb.toml` file and a src directory with a `lib.cairo` file inside.

It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a `.gitignore` file

> Note: Git is a common version control system. You can stop using version control system by using the `--vcs` flag.
> Run `scarb new -help` to see the available options.

Open _Scarb.toml_ in your text editor of choice. It should look similar to the code in Listing 1-2.

<span class="filename">Filename: Scarb.toml</span>

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/manifest

[dependencies]
# foo = { path = "vendor/foo" }
```

<span class="caption">Listing 1-2: Contents of Scarb.toml generated by `scarb new`</span>

This file is in the [TOML](https://toml.io/) (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which is Scarb’s configuration format.

The first line, `[package]`, is a section heading that indicates that the following statements are configuring a package. As we add more information to this file, we’ll add other sections.

The next two lines set the configuration information Scarb needs to compile your program: the name and the version of Scarb to use.

The last line, `[dependencies]`, is the start of a section for you to list any of your project’s dependencies. In Cairo, packages of code are referred to as crates. We won’t need any other crates for this project.

> Note: If you're building contracts for Starknet, you will need to add the `starknet` dependency as mentioned in the [Scarb documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/extensions/starknet/starknet-package.html).

The other file created by Scarb is `src/lib.cairo`, let's delete all the content and put in the following content, we will explain the reason later.

```rust,noplayground
mod hello_world;
```

Then create a new file called `src/hello_world.cairo` and put the following code in it:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/hello_world.cairo</span>

```rust,file=hello_world.cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;
fn main() {
    'Hello, World!'.print();
}
```

We have just created a file called `lib.cairo`, which contains a module declaration referencing another module named `hello_world`, as well as the file `hello_world.cairo`, containing the implementation details of the `hello_world` module.

Scarb requires your source files to be located within the `src` directory.

The top-level project directory is reserved for README files, license information, configuration files, and any other non-code-related content.
Scarb ensures a designated location for all project components, maintaining a structured organization.

If you started a project that doesn’t use Scarb, you can convert it to a project that does use Scarb. Move the project code into the src directory and create an appropriate `Scarb.toml` file.

### Building a Scarb Project

From your `hello_world` directory, build your project by entering the following command:

```bash
$ scarb build
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///projects/Scarb.toml)
    Finished release target(s) in 0 seconds
```

This command creates a `sierra` file in `target/dev`, let's ignore the `sierra` file for now.

If you have installed Cairo correctly, you should be able to run and see the following output:

```shell
$ scarb cairo-run
running hello_world ...
[DEBUG] Hello, World!                   (raw: 0x48656c6c6f2c20776f726c6421

Run completed successfully, returning []
```

Regardless of your operating system, the string `Hello, world!` should print to
the terminal.

If `Hello, world!` did print, congratulations! You’ve officially written a Cairo
program. That makes you a Cairo programmer—welcome!

### Anatomy of a Cairo Program

Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:

```rust,noplayground
fn main() {

}
```

These lines define a function named `main`. The `main` function is special: it
is always the first code that runs in every executable Cairo program. Here, the
first line declares a function named `main` that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses `()`.

The function body is wrapped in `{}`. Cairo requires curly brackets around all
function bodies. It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same
line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.

> Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Cairo projects, you can
> use the automatic formatter tool available with `scarb fmt` to format your code in a
> particular style (more on `scarb fmt` in
> [Appendix D][devtools]). The Cairo team has included this tool
> with the standard Cairo distribution, as `cairo-run` is, so it should already be
> installed on your computer!

Prior to the main function declaration, The line `use debug::PrintTrait;` is responsible for importing an item defined in another module. In this case, we are importing the `PrintTrait` item from the Cairo core library. By doing so, we gain the ability to use the `print()` method on data types that are compatible with printing.

The body of the `main` function holds the following code:

```rust,noplayground
    'Hello, World!'.print();
```

This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the
screen. There are four important details to notice here.

First, Cairo style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.

Second, the `print()` function called is a method from the trait `PrintTrait`. This trait is imported from the Cairo core library, and it defines how to print values to the screen for different data types. In our case, our text is defined as a "short string", which is an ASCII string that can fit in Cairo's basic data type, which is the `felt252` type. By calling `Hello, world!'.print()`, we're calling the `print()` method of the `felt252` implementation of the `PrintTrait` trait.

Third, you see the `'Hello, World!'` short string. We pass this short string as an argument
to `print()`, and the short string is printed to the screen.

Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon (`;`), which indicates that this
expression is over and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Cairo code
end with a semicolon.

### Running tests

To run all the tests associated with a particular package, you can use the `scarb test` command.
It is not a test runner by itself, but rather delegates work to a testing solution of choice. Scarb comes with preinstalled `scarb cairo-test` extension, which bundles Cairo's native test runner. It is the default test runner used by scarb test.
To use third-party test runners, please refer to [Scarb's documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/extensions/testing.html#using-third-party-test-runners).

Test functions are marked with the `#[test]` attributes, and running `scarb test` will run all test functions in your codebase under the `src/` directory.

```txt
├── Scarb.toml
├── src
│   ├── lib.cairo
│   └── file.cairo
```

<span class="caption"> A sample Scarb project structure</span>

Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Scarb:

- We can create a project using `scarb new`.
- We can build a project using `scarb build` to generate the compiled Sierra code.
- We can define custom scripts in `Scarb.toml` and call them with the `scarb run` command.
- We can run tests using the `scarb test` command.

An additional advantage of using Scarb is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system you’re working on. So, at this point, we’ll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.


# Summary

You’re already off to a great start on your Cairo journey! In this chapter, you’ve learned how to:

- Install the latest stable version of Cairo
- Write and run a “Hello, Scarb!” program using `scarb` directly
- Create and run a new project using the conventions of Scarb
- Execute tests using the `scarb test` command

This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading and writing Cairo code.

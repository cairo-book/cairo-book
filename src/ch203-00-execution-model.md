# Execution Model

The CPU architecture of the Cairo VM defines how the VM processes instructions and changes its state. It's directly analogous to the Central Processing Unit (CPU) in a physical computer. In the Cairo VM, the CPU follows the principles of a Von Neumann architecture, where both program instructions and data reside in the same memory space. The VM's execution model is implemented as a repeating loop, known as the **fetch-decode-execute cycle**, which dictates how the machine advances from one state to the next.

The execution model is defined by its registers, a unique instruction set architecture, and the VM's state transition function.

## Registers

In any CPU architecture, registers are small, high-speed storage locations that hold the most immediately needed data for processing. The Cairo VM has three dedicated registers that are used to manage the program's flow and memory context. The state of the VM at any given moment is defined entirely by the values of these three registers, which are part of the execution trace that gets proven.

- The **`pc` (Program Counter)** holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed. After most instructions, it is incremented to point to the subsequent one, but jump and call instructions can modify it directly to continue from a different instruction.
- The **`ap` (Allocation Pointer)** functions as a stack pointer, conventionally pointing to the next free (unwritten) memory cell. Many instructions increment `ap` by 1, but this is not typically enforced.
- The **`fp` (Frame Pointer)** provides a stable reference point for the current function's execution context, or "stack frame." When a function is called, `fp` is set to the current value of `ap`. This allows the function to reliably access its arguments and its return address, which are located at fixed negative offsets relative to `fp`, regardless of how many local variables are allocated on the stack using `ap`.

## Instructions and Opcodes

A Cairo **instruction** is the complete computational unit for a single step, encoded as a 64-bit field element. This single word contains three 16-bit signed offsets (`off_dst`, `off_op0`, `off_op1`) and 15 different boolean flags, used to know which registers to use for addressing, what arithmetic operations to perform, and how to update the `pc`, `ap`, and `fp` registers for the next state.

The three offsets determine which memory cells the instruction reads/writes relative to the registers. The 15 flags encode what operation to perform and how to update registers. For example, flag groups include `dst_reg` (whether to write the result to `fp`, `ap`, or `pc`), `op0_reg`/`op1_reg` (whether operands come from `fp`, `ap`, or are immediate), arithmetic/logic operations, and control for jumps.

While there are many different instructions in the Cairo VM, the VM itself only supports three opcodes:

1.  **`CALL`**: Initiates a function call, saving the current context (`fp` and the return `pc`) to the stack.
2.  **`RET`**: Executes a function return, restoring the caller's context from the stack.
3.  **`ASSERT_EQ`**: Enforces an equality constraint.

## Cairo Assembly (CASM)

CASM is the human-readable assembly language for Cairo. It is the direct textual representation of the machine's instructions. A developer writes logic in the high-level Cairo language, and the compiler's final step is to translate this logic into a sequence of CASM instructions. However, one can also write CASM instructions by hand. Each valid line of CASM, such as `[fp + 1] = [ap - 2] + 5` or `jmp rel 17 if [ap] != 0`, corresponds to a specific instruction.

## State Transition

The state of the Cairo VM at any step \(i\) is fully captured by the tuple \((pc*i, ap_i, fp_i)\). The **state transition function** is the deterministic set of rules that computes the next state, \((pc*{i+1}, ap*{i+1}, fp*{i+1})\), based on the current state and the instruction fetched from memory. This process perfectly mirrors the classic fetch-decode-execute cycle of a physical CPU.

The entire cycle, from fetching the instruction to asserting its correctness and updating the registers, is a single, atomic step in the Cairo VM. This process is part of what is encoded into the polynomial constraints of the Cairo AIR, guaranteeing that every single step of a program's execution adheres to the rules of the VM and can be proven.

Conceptually, each step checks one instruction and enforces its semantics as algebraic constraints. For example, a typical instruction will load values from memory at addresses `pc + off_op0` and `pc + off_op1` (relative to registers), compute a result (add, multiply, sub), and then write it to memory at `pc + off_dst`. It will also set the next `pc`, possibly increment `ap`, and leave `fp` unchanged or restore it on return of a function call.

These rules are fully deterministic: given the current state and memory, there is exactly one valid next state for the Cairo VM.
The key point is that for every instruction, there exists a set of algebraic constraints in the AIR that must be satisfied. If at any step the constraints cannot be satisfied (for example, the VM executes an illegal state transition), the execution cannot be proven.

Conversely, if all steps pass, then, it is possible to generate a proof from this execution.

# Appendix D - The Cairo Prelude

## Prelude

The Cairo prelude is a collection of commonly used modules, functions, data
types, and traits that are automatically brought into scope of every module in a
Cairo crate without needing explicit import statements. Cairo's prelude provides
the basic building blocks developers need to start Cairo programs and writing
smart contracts.

The core library prelude is defined in the _[lib.cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/main/corelib/src/lib.cairo)_
file of the corelib crate and contains Cairo's primitive data types, traits,
operators, and utility functions. This includes:

- Data types: integers, bools, arrays, dicts, etc.
- Traits: behaviors for arithmetic, comparison, and serialization operations
- Operators: arithmetic, logical, bitwise
- Utility functions - helpers for arrays, maps, boxing, etc.

The core library prelude delivers the fundamental programming
constructs and operations needed for basic Cairo programs, without requiring the
explicit import of elements. Since the core library prelude is automatically
imported, its contents are available for use in any Cairo crate without explicit
imports. This prevents repetition and provides a better devX. This is what
allows you to use `ArrayTrait::append()` or the `Default` trait without bringing
them explicitly into scope.

You can choose which prelude to use. For example, adding `edition = "2024_07"` in the _Scarb.toml_ configuration file will load the prelude from July 2024. Note that when you create a new project using `scarb new` command, the _Scarb.toml_ file will automatically include `edition = "2024_07"`.
Different prelude versions will expose different functions and traits, so it is important to specify the correct edition in the _Scarb.toml_ file. Generally, you want to start a new project using the latest edition, and migrate to newer editions as they are released.

## Cairo editions

Here is the list of available Cairo editions (i.e prelude versions) with their details:

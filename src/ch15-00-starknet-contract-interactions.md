# Starknet Contract Interactions

The ability to create interactions between smart contracts on a blockchain is an important feature that allows for composability and separation of concerns. It makes it possible to create complex decentralized applications that grow over time, incorporating more and more components.

This chapter sheds light on how to make smart contracts interact with each other. Specifically, you'll learn how smart contract can expose entrypoints to other contracts, and how to facilitate seamless cross-contract communication.

Throughout this chapter, we'll encounter various technical concepts including smart contract interfaces, ABIs, contract and library dispatchers, along with their low-level system call equivalents. Let's delve into all these new concepts!

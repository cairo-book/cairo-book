# Interacting with Starknet Contracts

A smart contract cannot execute itself without an external trigger. It needs to be called by an external entity, such as a user or another smart contract. The possibility for smart contracts to interact with each other enables the creation of sophisticated applications, where the scope of each contract is restricted to a specific functionality.

This chapter sheds light on how to interact with smart contracts and make them interact with each other. Specifically, you'll learn what the _Application Binary Interface (ABI)_ is, how to call a smart contract, and how to make contracts communicate with each other. You will also learn how to properly use classes as _libraries_, and when to use them.

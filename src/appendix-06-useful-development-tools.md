# Appendix F - Useful Development Tools

In this appendix, we talk about some useful development tools that the Cairo
project provides. Weâ€™ll look at automatic formatting, quick ways to apply
warning fixes, a linter, and integrating with IDEs.

## Automatic Formatting with `scarb fmt`

Scarb projects can be formatted using the `scarb fmt` command.
If you're using the Cairo binaries directly, you can run `cairo-format` instead.
Many collaborative projects use `scarb fmt` to prevent arguments about which
style to use when writing Cairo: everyone formats their code using the tool.

To format any Cairo project, enter the following inside the project directory:

```bash
scarb fmt
```

For things you do not want `scarb fmt` to mangle, use `#[cairofmt::skip]`:

```cairo, noplayground
#[cairofmt::skip]
let table: Array<ByteArray> = array![
    "oxo",
    "xox",
    "oxo",
];
```

## IDE Integration Using `cairo-language-server`

To help IDE integration, the Cairo community recommends using the
[`cairo-language-server`][cairo-language-server]<!-- ignore -->. This tool is a set of
compiler-centric utilities that speaks the [Language Server Protocol][lsp]<!--
ignore -->, which is a specification for IDEs and programming languages to
communicate with each other. Different clients can use `cairo-language-server`, such as
[the Cairo extension for Visual Studio Code][vscode-cairo].

[lsp]: http://langserver.org/
[vscode-cairo]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1

Visit the `vscode-cairo` [page][vscode-cairo]<!-- ignore -->
to install it on VSCode. You will get abilities such as autocompletion, jump to
definition, and inline errors.

> Note: If you have Scarb installed, it should work out of the box with the Cairo VSCode extension, without a manual installation of the language server.

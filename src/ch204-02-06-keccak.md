# Keccak Builtin

The _Keccak_ builtin computes the new state `s'` after applying the 24 rounds of the keccak-f1600 block permutation on a given state `s`.

## Cells organization

The Keccak builtin has its own segment during a Cairo VM run which is organized by blocks of 16 cells.

- The 8 first cells are used to store the input state `s`. The state is a 1600-bit array, so each cell stores 200 bits.
- The 8 next cells are used to store the output state `s'`. The state is a 1600-bit array, so each cell stores 200 bits.

If the input of a cell is larger than 200 bits - or is not a valid integer, the VM will throw an
error. Upon accessing any of the output cells, the VM will compute the hash state of the 8 input
cells, and store the results in a cache to avoid re-computing it in case the same output cell is
accessed again.

Here is the expected hash of the input state `s` [0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6, 0x7, 0x8]:

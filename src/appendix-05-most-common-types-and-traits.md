## Appendix E - The cairo Prelude and Common Types & Traits

This appendix provides a prelude and a reference for common types and traits used in contract development, along with their corresponding imports, paths, and usage examples.

### Prelude

The following two codes bring the fundamentals for Cairo. They facilitate system interaction and smart contract management. Additionally, they establish the essential foundations for arithmetic, logical operations, and data management within smart contracts.

[Starknet.cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/v2.2.0/corelib/src/starknet.cairo) is a module layout, incorporating various traits, data types, and syscall declarations necessary for smart contract in Cairo and system-level operations within a Starknet environment. It includes modules for storage access, syscalls, cryptographic primitives (like secp256), contract and Ethereum addresses handling, event and account management, along with some helper functions and types for system interactions and error handling.

[Lib.cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/v2.2.0/corelib/src/lib.cairo) demonstrates extensive trait implementations, type definitions, and external function declarations, providing foundational operations for arithmetic, logical operations, and data type conversions within a StarkNet ecosystem. It structures fundamental data types like booleans, and user-defined types (e.g., felt252), and their associated operations while also defining external functions and methods for basic arithmetic and logical operations. This block also includes module declarations for various utility and core functionalities like box, array, dictionary handling, serialization, deserialization, and error handling which are crucial for smart contract development in Cairo.

| `OptionTrait`             | `core::option::OptionTrait`                            | `OptionTrait<T>` defines a set of methods required to manipulate optional value.                                                                                                       |
| `ResultTrait`             | `core::result::ResultTrait`                            | `ResultTrait<T, E>` Type for Starknet contract address, a value in the range [0, 2 \*\* 251).                                                                                          |
| `ContractAddress`         | `starknet::ContractAddress`                           | `ContractAddress` is a type to represent the smart contract address                                                                                                                    |
| `ContractAddressZeroable` | `starknet::contract_address::ContractAddressZeroable` | `ContractAddressZeroable` is the implementation of the trait `Zeroable` for the `ContractAddress` type. It is required to check whether a value of `t:ContractAddress` is zero or not. |
| `contract_address_const`  | `starknet::contract_address_const`                    | The `contract_address_const!` it's a function that allows instantiating constant contract address values.                                                                              |
| `Into`                    | `traits::Into;`                                       | `Into<T>` is a trait used for conversion between types. If there is an implementation of Into<T,S> for the types T and S, you can convert T into S.                                    |
| `TryInto`                 | `traits::TryInto;`                                    | `TryInto<T>` is a trait used for conversion between types.If there is an implementation of TryInto<T,S> for the types T and S, you can convert T into S.                               |
| `get_caller_address`      | `starknet::get_caller_address`                        | `get_caller_address()` is a function that returns the address of the caller of the contract. It can be used to identify the caller of a contract function.                             |
| `get_contract_address`    | `starknet::info::get_contract_address`                | `get_contract_address()` is a function that returns the address of the current contract. It can be used to obtain the address of the contract being executed.                          |

This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers some of the commonly used types and traits in contract development. For more details, refer to the official documentation and explore the available libraries and frameworks.

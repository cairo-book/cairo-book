# Concise Control Flow with `if let` and `while let`

## `if let`

The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the program in Listing {{#ref config_max}} that matches on an `Option::Some<u8>` value in the `config_max` variable but only wants to execute code if the value is `Option::Some` variant.

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no_listing_14_if_let_match_one/src/lib.cairo:match}}
```

{{#label config_max}}
<span class="caption">Listing {{#ref config_max}}: A `match` that only cares about executing
code when the value is `Option::Some`</span>

If the value is `Option::Some`, we print out the value in the `Option::Some` variant by binding
the value to the variable `max` in the pattern. We don’t want to do anything
with the `None` value. To satisfy the `match` expression, we have to add `_ =>
()` after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to
add.

Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let`. The following
code behaves the same as the `match` in Listing {{#ref config_max}}:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no_listing_15_if_let/src/lib.cairo:here}}
```

The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal
sign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to the
`match` and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is
`Option::Some(max)`, and the `max` binds to the value inside the `Option::Some`. We can then
use `max` in the body of the `if let` block in the same way we used `max` in
the corresponding `match` arm. The code in the `if let` block isn’t run if the
value doesn’t match the pattern.

Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.
However, you lose the exhaustive checking that `match` enforces. Choosing
between `match` and `if let` depends on what you’re doing in your particular
situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for
losing exhaustive checking.

In other words, you can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that
runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.

We can include an `else` with an `if let`. The block of code that goes with the
`else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in the
`match` expression that is equivalent to the `if let` and `else`. Recall the
`Coin` enum definition in Listing {{#ref match-pattern-bind}}, where the `Quarter` variant also held a
`UsState` value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also
announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a `match`
expression, like this:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no_listing_16_if_let_coiner_match/src/lib.cairo:here}}
```

Or we could use an `if let` and `else` expression, like this:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no_listing_17_if_let_coiner/src/lib.cairo:here}}
```

If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to
express using a `match`, remember that `if let` is in your Cairo toolbox as well.

## `while let`

The `while let` syntax is similar to the `if let` syntax, but it allows you to loop over a collection of values and execute a block of code for each value that matches a specified pattern. In the case below, the pattern is `Option::Some(x)`, which matches any `Some` variant of the `Option` enum.

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no_listing_18_while_let/src/lib.cairo}}
```

Using `while let` provides a more concise and idiomatic way of writing this loop compared to a traditional `while` loop with explicit pattern matching or handling of the `Option` type. However, as with `if let`, you lose the exhaustive checking that a `match` expression provides, so you need to be careful to handle any remaining cases outside the while let loop if necessary.

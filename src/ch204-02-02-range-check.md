# Range Check Builtin

Cairo's built-in Range Check is used for confirming that numerical values fall inside predetermined ranges. It guarantees that a value falls inside a certain range, like [0, 2^128). The Range Check builtin is a single component ensuring that a value is a field element (felt) within this range. There are not two separate builtins for different ranges. To enforce more stringent constraints, such as [0, 2^96], developers can implement custom range checks by combining the Range Check builtin with additional logic. Incorporating a range check directly into Cairo code requires breaking down a value into its binary form, which may need around 384 instructions. This estimate relies on the requirement to process every single bit of a 128-bit value, with each bit possibly needing several instructions for verification. Conversely, applying the Range Check builtin simplifies this procedure, cutting the task down to approximately 1.5 instructions, which greatly boosts efficiency. 
For example, the Range Check builtin only accepts felts and verify that such a felt is within the range [0, 2**128). A program can write a value to the Range Check builtin only if those two constraints hold. Those two constraints represent the validation property of the Range Check builtin.

Range checking in Cairo works similarly to a queue, a data structure used for number validation. Numbers that need to be validated are stored in the queue. All figures are compared to a threshold limit (2^128 - 1). If a number goes over the predetermined limit, it will be rejected but if it does not and stays in the limit that was set, then it will pass through. A value can only go through the Range Check if itâ€™s a valid felt and within the allowed range. This ensures your program always works with safe and valid numbers automatically.

In the Cairo Virtual Machine (VM), the Range Check Segment enables you to input numerical values straight into it. It doesn't proactively look for values; instead, you can enter any value, and the system will automatically check if it is within the acceptable range. For instance, numbers in the interval [0, 2^128 - 1] are regarded as valid, whereas numbers beyond this interval are considered invalid.

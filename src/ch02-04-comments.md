# Comments

In Cairo programs, you can include explanatory text within the code using comments. To create a comment, use the // syntax, after which any text on the same line will be ignored by the compiler.

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch02-common-programming-concepts/no_listing_23_comments/src/lib.cairo}}
```

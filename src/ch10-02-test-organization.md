# Testing Organization

We'll think about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation at a time, and can test private functions. Integration tests use your code in the same way any other external code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple modules per test.

Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.

## Unit Tests

The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn’t working as expected. You’ll put unit tests in the `src` directory in each file with the code that they’re testing.

The convention is to create a module named `tests` in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with `#[cfg(test)]` attribute.

### The Tests Module and `#[cfg(test)]`

The `#[cfg(test)]` annotation on the tests module tells Cairo to compile and run the test code only when you run `scarb cairo-test`, not when you run `scarb cairo-run`. This saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves space in the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You’ll see that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don’t need the `#[cfg(test)]` annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same files as the code, you’ll use `#[cfg(test)]` to specify that they shouldn’t be included in the compiled result.

Recall that when we created the new _adder_ project in the first section of this chapter, we wrote this first test:

<span class="caption">Filename: src/lib.cairo</span>

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch10-testing-cairo-programs/no_listing_08_cfg_attr/src/lib.cairo}}
```

The attribute `cfg` stands for configuration and tells Cairo that the following item should only be included given a certain configuration option. In this case, the configuration option is `test`, which is provided by Cairo for compiling and running tests. By using the `cfg` attribute, Cairo compiles our test code only if we actively run the tests with `scarb cairo-test`. This includes any helper functions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions annotated with `#[test]`.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests use your library in the same way any other code would. Their purpose is to test whether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration tests, you first need a `tests` directory.

### The _tests_ Directory

```shell
adder
├── Scarb.toml
├── src
│   ├── lib.cairo
│   ├── tests
│   │   └── integration_test.cairo
│   └── tests.cairo
```

First of all, add the following code in your _lib.cairo_ file:

<span class="caption">Filename: src/lib.cairo</span>

```rust, noplayground
{{#include ../listings/ch10-testing-cairo-programs/no_listing_09_integration_test/src/lib.cairo}}
```

Note that we still need to use the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute here, because we are in the _lib.cairo_ file of the _src_ directory.
Then, create a _tests.cairo_ file and fill it as follows:

<span class="caption">Filename: src/tests.cairo</span>

```rust, noplayground
{{#include ../listings/ch10-testing-cairo-programs/no_listing_09_integration_test/src/tests.cairo}}
```

Finally, enter this code into the _src/tests/integration_test.cairo_ file:

<span class="caption">Filename: src/tests/integration_test.cairo</span>

```rust, noplayground
{{#include ../listings/ch10-testing-cairo-programs/no_listing_09_integration_test/src/tests/integration_tests.cairo}}
```

We need to bring our tested functions into each test file scope. For that reason we add `use adder::it_adds_two` at the top of the code, which we didn’t need in the unit tests.

Then, to run all of our integration tests, we can just add a filter to only run tests whose path contains "integration_tests".

```shell
{{#include ../listings/ch10-testing-cairo-programs/no_listing_09_integration_test/output.txt}}
```

The result of the tests is the same as what we've been seeing: one line for each test.

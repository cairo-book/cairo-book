# Getting Started

Let’s start your Cairo journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

- Installing Scarb, which is Cairo's build toolchain and package manager, on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Installing Starknet Foundry, which is the default test runnner when creating a Cairo project.
- Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`.
- Using basic Scarb commands to create a project and execute a program.

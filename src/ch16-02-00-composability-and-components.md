# Components: Lego-Like Building Blocks for Smart Contracts

Developing contracts sharing a common logic and storage can be painful and
bug-prone, as this logic can hardly be reused and needs to be reimplemented in
each contract. But what if there was a way to snap in just the extra
functionality you need inside your contract, separating the core logic of your
contract from the rest?

Components provide exactly that. They are modular add-ons encapsulating reusable
logic, storage, and events that can be incorporated into multiple contracts.
They can be used to extend a contract's functionality, without having to
reimplement the same logic over and over again.

Think of components as Lego blocks. They allow you to enrich your contracts by
plugging in a module that you or someone else wrote. This module can be a simple
one, like an ownership component, or more complex like a full-fledged ERC20
token.

A component is a separate module that can contain storage, events, and
functions. Unlike a contract, a component cannot be declared or deployed. Its
logic will eventually be part of the contract’s bytecode it has been embedded
in.

## What's in a Component?

A component is very similar to a contract. It can contain:

- Storage variables
- Events
- External and internal functions

Unlike a contract, a component cannot be deployed on its own. The component's
code becomes part of the contract it's embedded to.

## Creating Components

To create a component, first define it in its own module decorated with a
`#[starknet::component]` attribute. Within this module, you can declare a `
Storage` struct and `Event` enum, as usually done in [contracts][contract anatomy].

The next step is to define the component interface, containing the signatures of
the functions that will allow external access to the component's logic. You can
define the interface of the component by declaring a trait with the
`#[starknet::interface]` attribute, just as you would with contracts. This
interface will be used to enable external access to the component's functions
using the [dispatcher][contract dispatcher] pattern.

The actual implementation of the component's external logic is done in an `impl`
block marked as `#[embeddable_as(name)]`. Usually, this `impl` block will be an
implementation of the trait defining the interface of the component.

> Note: `name` is the name that we’ll be using in the contract to refer to the
> component. It is different than the name of your impl.

You can also define internal functions that will not be accessible externally,
by simply omitting the `#[embeddable_as(name)]` attribute above the internal
`impl` block. You will be able to use these internal functions inside the
contract you embed the component in, but not interact with it from outside, as
they're not a part of the abi of the contract.

Functions within these `impl` block expect arguments like `ref self:
ComponentState<TContractState>` (for state-modifying functions) or `self:
@ComponentState<TContractState>` (for view functions). This makes the impl
generic over `TContractState`, allowing us to use this component in any
contract.

### Example: an Ownable Component

The interface of the Ownable component, defining the methods available
externally to manage ownership of a contract, would look like this:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../listings/ch16-building-advanced-starknet-smart-contracts/listing_02_ownable_component/src/component.cairo:interface}}
```

The component itself is defined as:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../listings/ch16-building-advanced-starknet-smart-contracts/listing_02_ownable_component/src/component.cairo:component}}
```

This syntax is actually quite similar to the syntax used for contracts. The only
differences relate to the `#[embeddable_as]` attribute above the impl and the
genericity of the impl block that we will dissect in details.

As you can see, our component has two `impl` blocks: one corresponding to the
implementation of the interface trait, and one containing methods that should
not be exposed externally and are only meant for internal use. Exposing the
`assert_only_owner` as part of the interface wouldn't make sense, as it's only
meant to be used internally by a contract embedding the component.

## A Closer Look at the `impl` Block

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../listings/ch16-building-advanced-starknet-smart-contracts/listing_02_ownable_component/src/component.cairo:impl_signature}}
```

The `#[embeddable_as]` attribute is used to mark the impl as embeddable inside a
contract. It allows us to specify the name of the impl that will be used in the
contract to refer to this component. In this case, the component will be
referred to as `Ownable` in contracts embedding it.

The implementation itself is generic over `ComponentState<TContractState>`, with
the added restriction that `TContractState` must implement the `HasComponent<T>`
trait. This allows us to use the component in any contract, as long as the
contract implements the `HasComponent` trait. Understanding this mechanism in
details is not required to use components, but if you're curious about the inner
workings, you can read more in the ["Components Under the Hood"][components inner working] section.

One of the major differences from a regular smart contract is that access to
storage and events is done via the generic `ComponentState<TContractState>` type
and not `ContractState`. Note that while the type is different, accessing
storage or emitting events is done similarly via `self.storage_var_name.read()`
or `self.emit(...).`

> Note: To avoid the confusion between the embeddable name and the impl name, we
> recommend keeping the suffix `Impl` in the impl name.

## Migrating a Contract to a Component

Since both contracts and components share a lot of similarities, it's actually
very easy to migrate from a contract to a component. The only changes required
are:

- Adding the `#[starknet::component]` attribute to the module.
- Adding the `#[embeddable_as(name)]` attribute to the `impl` block that will be
  embedded in another contract.
- Adding generic parameters to the `impl` block:
  - Adding `TContractState` as a generic parameter.
  - Adding `+HasComponent<TContractState>` as an impl restriction.
- Changing the type of the `self` argument in the functions inside the `impl`
  block to `ComponentState<TContractState>` instead of `ContractState`.

For traits that do not have an explicit definition and are generated using
`#[generate_trait]`, the logic is the same - but the trait is generic over
`TContractState` instead of `ComponentState<TContractState>`, as demonstrated in
the example with the `InternalTrait`.

## Using Components Inside a Contract

The major strength of components is how it allows reusing already built
primitives inside your contracts with a restricted amount of boilerplate. To
integrate a component into your contract, you need to:

1. Declare it with the `component!()` macro, specifying

   1. The path to the component `path::to::component`.
   2. The name of the variable in your contract's storage referring to this
      component's storage (e.g. `ownable`).
   3. The name of the variant in your contract's event enum referring to this
      component's events (e.g. `OwnableEvent`).

2. Add the path to the component's storage and events to the contract's
   `Storage` and `Event`. They must match the names provided in step 1 (e.g.
   `ownable: ownable_component::Storage` and `OwnableEvent:
ownable_component::Event`).

   The storage variable **MUST** be annotated with the `#[substorage(v0)]`
   attribute.

3. Embed the component's logic defined inside your contract, by instantiating
   the component's generic impl with a concrete `ContractState` using an impl
   alias. This alias must be annotated with `#[abi(embed_v0)]` to externally
   expose the component's functions.

   As you can see, the InternalImpl is not marked with `#[abi(embed_v0)]`.
   Indeed, we don't want to expose externally the functions defined in this
   impl. However, we might still want to access them internally.

For example, to embed the `Ownable` component defined above, we would do the
following:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../listings/ch16-building-advanced-starknet-smart-contracts/listing_02_ownable_component/src/contract.cairo:all}}
```

The component's logic is now seamlessly part of the contract! We can interact
with the components functions externally by calling them using the
`IOwnableDispatcher` instantiated with the contract's address.

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch16-building-advanced-starknet-smart-contracts/listing_02_ownable_component/src/component.cairo:interface}}
```

## Stacking Components for Maximum Composability

The composability of components really shines when combining multiple of them
together. Each adds its features onto the contract. You can rely on
[Openzeppelin's][OpenZeppelin Cairo Contracts] implementation
of components to quickly plug-in all the common functionalities you need a contract
to have.

Developers can focus on their core contract logic while relying on battle-tested
and audited components for everything else.

Components can even [depend][component dependencies] on other components by restricting the
`TContractstate` they're generic on to implement the trait of another component.
Before we dive into this mechanism, let's first look at [how components work under the hood][components inner working].

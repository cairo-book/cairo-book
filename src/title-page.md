# The Cairo Book

By the Cairo Community and its [contributors](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book.github.io). Special thanks to [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) through [OnlyDust](https://www.onlydust.xyz/), and [Voyager](https://voyager.online/) for supporting the creation of this book.

This version of the text assumes youâ€™re using the [Cairo Compiler](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) [version 2.8.3](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/releases) and [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html) [version 0.31.0](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/releases). See the [Installation](ch01-01-installation.md) section of Chapter {{#chap getting-started}} to install or update Cairo and Starknet Foundry.

If you want to play around with Cairo code and see how it compiles into Sierra (Intermediate Representation) and CASM (Cairo Assembly), you can use [cairovm.codes](https://cairovm.codes/) playground.

# The Cairo Book

By the Cairo Community and its [contributors](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book.github.io). Special thanks to [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) through [OnlyDust](https://www.onlydust.xyz/), and [Voyager](https://voyager.online/) for supporting the creation of this book.

This version of the text assumes youâ€™re using the [Cairo Compiler](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) [version 2.5.3](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/releases). See the [Installation](ch01-01-installation.md) section of Chapter 1 to install or update Cairo.

If you want to play around with Cairo code and see how it compiles into Sierra (Intermediate Representation) and CASM (Cairo Assembly), you can use [cairovm.codes](https://cairovm.codes/) playground.

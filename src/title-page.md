# The Cairo Book

_By the Cairo Community and its [contributors](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book.github.io). Special thanks to [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) through [OnlyDust](https://www.onlydust.xyz/), and [Voyager](https://voyager.online/) for supporting the creation of this book._

This version of the text assumes youâ€™re using [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) [version 2.9.2](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/releases) and [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html) [version 0.35.1](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/releases). See the [Installation](ch01-01-installation.md) section of Chapter {{#chap getting-started}} to install or update Cairo and Starknet Foundry.

While reading this book, if you want to experiment with Cairo code and see how it compiles into Sierra (Intermediate Representation) and CASM (Cairo Assembly), you can use the [cairovm.codes](https://cairovm.codes/) playground.

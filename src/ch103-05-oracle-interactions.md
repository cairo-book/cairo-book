# Oracle Interactions

This section focuses on the concept of bringing off-chain data to the Starknet blockchain using oracles. Oracles are third-party services that serve as intermediaries, securely transmitting external data, such as asset prices, weather information, or other real-world data, to blockchains and smart contracts. It also provides practical examples and code snippets, including how to use [Pragma price feeds](https://docs.pragma.build/Resources/Starknet/data-feeds/consuming-data) and [Cartridge VRF](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/vrf) for verifiable random numbers in games.
